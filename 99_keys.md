## Mod-tap

Acts like a modifier when held; a normal key when pressed.
Probably very nice for shift/control since those are prime real-estate
and only ever used for holding

## Key Lock

Hitting a mod key -> key is held down for subsequent inputs until hit again which releases it.

<hr/>

##  OSM / one shot modifier

- When you hit a key, it remains active until the next key is pressed, and
is then released. 
- When held normally, they act like normal modifiers.


Eg: 
- Tapping OSM shift -> KC_K -> KC_A = Ka

- Holding OSM shift -> KC_K -> KC_A -> release OSM shift = KA

</hr>

##  OSL / one shot layer

See above; but for layer switching.

<hr/>

## Permissive hold 

Hitting a tap key, hitting then releasing a 2nd key, and then releasing the original tap key (within the TAPPING_TERM) yields the tapping behavior for both keys

<hr/>

## Ignore Mod Tap Interrupt

##  Tapping Force Hold

## Retro Tapping
